## üå± About Matcha

**Matcha** is a small but mighty **self-balancing robot** developed at **Fulbright University Vietnam**.  
Powered by **Reinforcement Learning (PPO & Vision RL)**, Matcha learns how to stand, balance, and move ‚Äî just like a curious little student exploring physics and AI at the same time.

Matcha‚Äôs name comes from the calm and balanced spirit of **green tea** üçµ ‚Äî a perfect metaphor for harmony between **control theory** and **machine learning**.

## üß† What Matcha Can Do

- Learns to **self-balance** dynamically using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).  
- Can perceive the world using **camera input** (End-to-End Vision RL).  
- Learns directly from experience ‚Äî no explicit physics model needed!  
- Cute wobbling moments included üíö

## üß© Tech Stack

- **Simulation:** PyBullet / Mujoco  
- **RL Framework:** Stable-Baselines3 (PPO)  
- **Vision Encoder:** CNN / ResNet backbone  
- **Hardware:** ESP32 + MPU6050 + DC Motors + IMU sensor  
- **Language:** Python, C++ (firmware)  
- **Logging:** TensorBoard, CSVMonitor

## üöÄ Research Goals

1. Compare **PPO (state-based)** vs **End-to-End Vision RL** on balancing stability and learning efficiency.  
2. Explore **Sim2Real Transfer** ‚Äî teaching Matcha in simulation, then deploying on the real robot.  
3. Contribute an open-source **Fulbright robotics learning platform** for students and AI enthusiasts.
